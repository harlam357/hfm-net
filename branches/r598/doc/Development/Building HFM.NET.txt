HFM.NET is written in Microsoft C# and is developed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

If you do not have Visual Studio 2010 Professional or better you can download the free Visual Studio 2010 
C# Express edition here: 

http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express

If you need help or if you find there is something I omitted that needs included or would help clarify the 
process please create a post at the HFM.NET Google Group.  Patches from the community are welcome.

Assembly Signing
----------------

All HFM.NET projects are delay signed.  To allow these projects to run on a development machine please see
the file in this folder named "How to register the HFM public key.txt".  Alternatively, you can remove the
signing from each project file in the project's properties window (right-click on the project and select 
properties).


Compiling within Visual Studio
------------------------------

There are two main solutions files available in the source control repository beneath the \src folder.

- HFM.sln:     This solution file contains all the projects necessary to build and run HFM.NET.
- HFM.All.sln: This solution file contains everything in the above solution plus the HFM.NET tools and
               NUnit unit test projects.

Each solution file is setup to build for either Any CPU or x86 platform.  Use the x86 platform to compile
in Visual Studio.  HFM.NET has a compile time dependency on a 32-bit (x86) unmanaged SQLite library.  If
HFM.NET is built and run from within Visual Studio on a 64-bit operating system it will not load correctly
due to the dependency on the 32-bit unmanaged libray.  If you want to build the complete HFM.NET
distribution that will load either a 32-bit or 64-bit SQLite library then please see the section below
Compiling with the HFM.NET MSBuild Script.


If you simply want to build the latest version of HFM.NET then all you need to do is compile the projects
in the HFM.sln file.

If you want to make your own changes to HFM.NET then I suggest you load the HFM.All.sln file so you can 
validate your changes using the HFM.NET unit test projects.

There are several options available for executing NUnit (http://www.nunit.org/) unit tests.

- The easiest is to use the built-in NUnit test runner available in the source code repository:

  \lib\NUnit\bin\net-2.0\nunit.exe
  \lib\NUnit\bin\net-2.0\nunit-x86.exe

- TestDriven.Net is a great tool and available here (free):  http://www.testdriven.net/
- I personally use ReSharper from JetBrains (commercial):    http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/


Compiling with the HFM.NET MSBuild Script
-----------------------------------------

Prerequisites
-------------
- MSBuild Community Tasks v1.2.0.306: http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/
- MSBuild Extension Pack v4.0.5.0:    http://msbuildextensionpack.codeplex.com/
- CollabNet Subversion Client v1.6.x: http://www.collab.net/downloads/subversion/svn-other.html

The HFM.NET MSBuild Script is setup to build HFM.NET in Release mode for the Any CPU platform.  It will 
also automatically run all the NUnit unit test projects.  On a successful compile, the script will copy 
the distribution files to a the \src\Artifacts\HFM.NET folder.

HFM.NET is compiled to run under the Microsoft.NET Framework v4.0 Client Profile and is built using the
Microsoft.NET Framework v4.0 tool chain.

To execute the build script open a Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt by going to the Start menu > 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 > Visual Studio Tools > Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010).  If you're using 
Visual Studio 2010 Express you will need to open a standard command propmt and execute the msbuild engine 
from either of the following two locations depending on OS platform.

- 32-bit: C:\WINDOWS\microsoft.net\Framework\v4.0.30319
- 64-bit: C:\WINDOWS\microsoft.net\Framework64\v4.0.30319

You can execute the build script from the \src folder as seen below.  Note that the version of the msbuild
engine is echoed in the command prompt.

C:\...\src>C:\WINDOWS\microsoft.net\Framework64\v4.0.30319\msbuild HFM.msbuild
Microsoft (R) Build Engine Version 4.0.30319.1
[Microsoft .NET Framework, Version 4.0.30319.261]
